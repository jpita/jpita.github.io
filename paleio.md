## Personal part
Hello there!

I'm Jose Pita, a *suspicious*, __attentive__ and communicative Quality Assurance Engineer.  
I help companies make sure their users have a bug free experience.  
On my off time I like to travel, go to concerts and meet new people.

## Complementary skills
I started as an automation tester fresh outta college and then worked on my testing skills.  
As a tester you need to have an overview on how the product works as a whole, front end code, backend code, databases, communication with apis, devops and systems, business interests and priorities, customer support and design teams.  
I'm always learning new skills and languages (programming and spoken) as the speed things change in the tech world is mind blowing (the same in life itself).  
I love how test automation lets me (and my colleagues) sleep at night and avoid repetition of work.

## Experience
Since July 2012 I've worked in a wide range of methodologies, industries, technologies and countries.  
The best skill I've learned and make sure to continue to improve, is how to communicate and get all the information you from people I talk to.  

## Availability
Right not I'm working in sunny Barcelona @ [teamcmp](teamcmp.com).  
I'm not looking to relocate (specially for a northern cold country), but would be very much interested in a full time remote work position.
