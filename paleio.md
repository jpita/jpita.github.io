## Personal part
Hello there!

I'm Jose Pita, a *suspicious*, __attentive__ and communicative Quality Assurance Engineer.  
I help companies make sure their users have a bug free experience.  
On my off time I like to travel, go to concerts and meet new people.

## Complementary skills
I started as an automation tester and then complemented my testing skills.  
As a tester you need to have an overview on how the product works as a whole, front end code, backend code, databases, communication with apis, devops and systems, business interests and priorities, customer support and design teams.  
I'm always trying to learn new skills and languages as the speed things change in the tech world is mind blowing.

## Experience
Since July 2012 I worked in a wide range of methodologies, industries, technologies and countries.  
The best skill I learned and make sure to continue to improve is how to communicate with people and how to get all the information from people.
